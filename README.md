# BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION ####

### DESCRIPTION:
  In this project, I have developed an application for Bitcoin price prediction using the Weighted Ensemble algorithm, which achieves more than 95% accuracy on the given dataset. This project can be used to predict Bitcoin prices in the future. I aim to optimize this project to accept any dataset for training the model in the future.
