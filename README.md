# BITCOIN PRICE PREDICTION ####

### DESCRIPTION:
  In this project I have developed an application for the bitcoin price prediction using Weighted ensemble algorithm which gives more than 95% of accuracy for the given dataset.We can use this project to predict the bitcoin price in the future. I hope to optimize this project to accept any dataset to train the model in the future.
